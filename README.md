This repository is my personal journey through PyTorch.  
It starts from the very basics and builds step by step, with each chapter introducing a new concept and a practical example.

## Chapters

1. **Basics**  
   Setting up PyTorch, tensors, and simple operations.

2. **Tensor Operations**  
   Working with tensors: reshaping, indexing, broadcasting, and math operations.

3. **Autograd**  
   Understanding automatic differentiation and gradients with `torch.autograd`.

4. **First Neural Network**  
   A simple feedforward neural network trained to approximate `sin(xÂ²)`.  
   Includes training/test split, loss curves, parameter and gradient norms, and evaluation.
